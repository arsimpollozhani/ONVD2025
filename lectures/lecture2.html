    <h3>Hands on Example</h3>
    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
        desk, lying between the copies of <cite>Nature</cite>, <cite>New Scientist</cite>, and all the other
        scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of
        <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the
        longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        <br> <br>
        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an
        Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have
            nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work,
        unraveling the secrets of the llama <abrr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abrr>, to be an outstanding achievement,
        Molly did think she had something better to do.
