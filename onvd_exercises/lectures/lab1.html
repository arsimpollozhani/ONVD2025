<h1>How to Survive Probability and Statistics</h1>
<p>Ah yes, Probability and Statistics, the course where dreams go to die, and calculators get abused beyond reason. They
    say it's the hardest course, but honestly, that's just a fancy way of saying "it's a wild guessing game with extra
    math." But don't worry, young warrior, here’s a foolproof (or at least somewhat effective) guide to making it
    through.</p>
<h2>Steps to Success (Or At Least Survival):</h2>
<ol>
    <li id="firstHeader">Accept Your Fate</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc " class="first-list-section">
        <li>This is happening. <span id="cry-later">You can cry about it later.</span></li>
        <li>Probability says there’s a non-zero chance you’ll pass.</li>
        <li>If ancient mathematicians did it without <span id="google-link"><a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a></span>, so can you.</li>
        <li>Embrace the chaos. It's the best way to get through.</li>
        <li>After all, chaos is just an advanced form of probability.</li>
        <li>It's like a random variable—you never know what you'll get, but you hope it's not a zero.</li>
    </ul>
    <li id="secondHeader">Master the Art of Selective Attention</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Not everything in class is important. Probably.</li>
        <li> Pay attention to whatever the professor repeats. It's on the test.</li>
        <li> Act <em>like</em> you understand when they ask questions. Nod wisely.</li>
    </ul>
    <li id="thirdHeader">Develop a Deep, Unhealthy Relationship with Your Calculator</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Learn every function. Yes, <b>even</b> the weird ones.</li>
        <li> Memorize <b>shortcuts</b>, or suffer.</li>
        <li> - Give it a name. It’s your <b>only</b> friend now.</li>
    </ul>
    <li id="fourthHeader">Guess with Confidence</li>
    <ul>
        <li> If you're unsure, pick the answer that sounds fancy.</li>
        <li> When in doubt, say "normal distribution." People love that.</li>
        <li> Use the power of educated guessing—it's like gambling, but legal.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
